The solubility of lipases in water is very poor, that is why the

            In a biological system, two enantiomers of a chiral compound may exhibit very distinct
            behaviors. Indeed, when a racemic mixture is used as a chiral drug, whose enantiomers display
            different biological effects, generally only one of the enantiomers is biologically active,
            whereas the other is either inactive or produces side-effects, including toxicity. For this reason,

           <p>In order to enhance the enantioselectivity and stability of an enzyme, there are different
            biochemical techniques. The most commonly used of these techniques is the immobilization of

            The immobilization of enzymes with covalent binding generally cause denaturation of 
            enzyme and the loss of catalytic activity due to the limitation of conformational changes
            and generation of rigid structures along immobilization. On the other hand, the stability of
            enzymes will be increased considerably, and the leakage of the enzyme could be decreased

            ligands, and substrate analogues in order to protect the active center of the enzyme during
            the immobilization process. Therefore, when the active center of the enzyme captured by a
            substrate molecule, the conformational change of the enzyme can be reduced, and its
            catalytic activity can be protected during covalent binding <span  title="23. Ozturk, T. K., & Kilinc, A. (2010).

            ions,    <b>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub></b> nanoparticles with small particle size and large surface area can easily

            the aggregation of the <b>GO</b> nanosheets and maintain the large surface area of the support
            material. Moreover, because of the excellent magnetic properties of  <b>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub></b>nanoparticles,

            <p>In this study, it is aimed to increase the enzymatic activity and enantioselectivity of
            <b>Cal-B</b> by immobilizing it onto  Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles,   <b>GO</b> nanosheets and <b>GO/ Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub></b>

            firstly prepared; subsequently, they were immobilized by covalent attachment of

            the enantioselective transesterification reaction of <b>(R, S)-1-phenylethanol</b> for the first
