        <h3 id="section-r1">⭒ Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy Analysis</h3>
        <p>FTIR was utilized to analyze the efficiency of covalent immobilization.<a href="#figure r1" id="figure-link"> Figure 1a.</a> shows the
            FTIR spectra of pure GO and enzyme immobilized GO. The spectrum of GO shows the
            broadband at 3410 cm<sup>-1</sup> that assigned to O-H stretching vibrations of the C-OH groups, the
            band at 1737 cm<sup>-1</sup> shows C=O stretching vibrations of the carbonyl and carboxylic groups and
            the absorption band at 1620 cm<sup>-1</sup> because of the existence of C=C or demonstrates the skeletal
            vibrations due to unoxidized graphitic domains [45, 46]. The spectra of Cal-B immobilized
            GO clearly indicate the following bands: 3425 cm<sup>-1</sup> (O-H, NH<sub>2</sub>) due to water and Cal-B,
            1647 cm<sup>-1</sup> (C=O) corresponding to Amid I, 1550 cm<sup>-1</sup> corresponding to Amid II bands of C-N
            stretching vibrations and N-H bending. <a href="#figure r1" id="figure-link"> Figure 1b.</a> shows FTIR spectra of pure Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and lipase immobilized Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. It can be seen that before lipase immobilization onto Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, the Fe-O
            vibrations of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> centered at 695 cm<sup>-1</sup>, after Cal-B immobilization this peak shifted to
            650 cm<sup>-1</sup> due to the interaction of enzyme and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles. The large and broad band
            is detected at 3423 cm<sup>-1</sup> demonstrating the existence of both the OH and NH<sub>2</sub> groups of water
            and Cal-B molecules [32]. Amide I band is the most intense absorption band of proteins that
            gives a peak at 1643 cm<sup>-1</sup>. It is caused by the stretching vibrations of the C-N (from 10% to
            20%) and C=O groups (from 70 to 85%) [47]. Amid II band is attributed to the N-H bending
            and C-N stretching vibrations at 1550 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The presence of several characteristic peaks of
            GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> such as Fe-O vibrations (573 cm<sup>-1</sup>), C–OH stretching vibration (1217 cm<sup>-1</sup>) [48],
            aromatic C=C stretching (1600 cm<sup>-1</sup>) and oxygen stretching vibrations (3440 cm<sup>-1</sup>) show the successful preparation of GO/Fe<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> nanocomposite <a href="#figure r1" id="figure-link">(Fig. 1c)</a>. After enzyme immobilized onto
            the support, the bands corresponded to chemical structure of enzyme was appeared at
            1061 cm<sup>-1</sup> (C-N stretching vibrations for aliphatic amines), 1550 cm<sup>-1</sup> (Amid II),
            1647 cm<sup>-1</sup> (Amid I band), 2353–2357 cm<sup>-1</sup> (the adsorption doublet band of CO<sub>2</sub>), and
            3440 cm<sup>-1</sup> (O-H and N-H absorption). The spectroscopic examination verifies that the enzyme
            Cal-B was successfully immobilized on the surface of supports.</p>

        <h3 id="section-r3">⭒ The Effect of pH and Temperature on Immobilization</h3>
        <p>One of the most important parameters that cause alteration of the enzyme activity in aqueous solutions is pH. 
            The pH change of the medium during immobilization affects the tertiary structure and active site of the enzyme molecules [49]. 
            To determine the
            impact of pH on immobilization, activation of the supports (with crosslinkers, 30 °C,
            4 h) and the immobilization of Cal-B onto the supports (30 °C, 12 h) were carried out
            at various pH values (pH 5–8). The effect of pH on the immobilization protocol is
            shown in <a href="#figure r3" id="figure-link"> Fig. 3a.</a> The highest enzyme activity was obtained at pH 6 (13.29 U/mg) for
            GO-GLA-CalB enzyme, at pH 7 (11.85 U/mg) for Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GLA-CalB and at pH 8
            (12.96 U/mg) for GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GLA-CalB.
            When these values are compared with the free enzyme activity (18.52 U/mg, pH 6,
            37 °C) in the optimum conditions, it can be seen that the activities of three immobilized
            enzymes decreased. The relative activities of immobilized samples are 72%, 64%, and
            70% for GO-GLA-CalB, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GLA-CalB, and GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GLA-CalB, respectively. The
            pH values demonstrate that there is no significant conformational change in the GO-GLA-CalB (pH 6) and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GLA-CalB (pH 7) enzymes during covalent binding</p>
            <!--FIGURE-->
            <details id="figure r3" ><summary>Figure 3-a, b</summary>
                <figure>
                  <img src="images/result3.png" class="images6">
                </figure>
                </details>
                <p>However, the results represent that lipase immobilized onto  GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GLA-CalB exhibits higher resistance to pH (pH 8.0). Miletic et al. [50] found similar result in their
                    study for Cal-B immobilized on polystyrene nanoparticles. In order to observe the effect
                    of reaction temperature on immobilization, the activation of the supports and the immobilization protocol were carried out at different temperatures (30–60 °C, pH 7.0), and the
                    results are shown in  <a href="#figure r3" id="figure-link"> Fig. 3b. </a>The optimum reaction temperature of the free lipase is
                    30 °C, while the immobilized enzymes represent the best catalytic activities at 40 °C. At
                    this temperature, the relative activities of GO-GLA-CalB, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GLA-CalB, and GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GLA-CalB are 74.2%, 81.4%, and 75.15%, respectively. Activity recovery of Candida rugosa enzyme immobilized onto GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanocomposite was obtained as
                    64.9% by Xie and Huang [37]. According to these results, their resistance to thermal
                    denaturation is better than the free lipase. As the result of the immobilization, molecules
                    have limited conformational mobility, thus stability is increased against various
                    deactivating forces. Similar values were obtained by Y ılmaz et al. [51] when the
                    Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) was encapsulated within chemically inert sol-gel composite matrixes. The main reason of the improved stabilitiy is the covalent bonds between
                    the enzyme and the matrix, which restrict the conformational mobility of the molecules
                    and cause the rigidity and stability of the enzyme to increase [52].
                    The reaction time is very important for enzyme immobilization. If there is an insufficient
                    interaction, the enzyme cannot bind on the support or the enzyme may be denatured because of
                    a longer duration of the interaction.
                    <a href="#figure r4" id="figure-link"> Figure 4</a> shows the catalytic activity of immobilized lipases prepared at various
                    immobilization times. As seen in  <a href="#figure r4" id="figure-link"> Fig. 4.</a>, it is clear that the catalytic activities of the
                    three immobilized enzymes are different for all immobilization times. Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GLA-CalB shows the best activity for 16 h. At this time, the catalytic activity of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GLA-CalB is 13.73 U/mg. However, the catalytic activities decreased after 16 h. This phenomenon can be related to denaturation of lipases at a long time. Optimum
                    immobilization time for GO-GLA-CalB and GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GLA-CalB is 12 h at which
                    the activities are 14.17 U/mg and 13.12 U/mg, respectively. Longer time slightly
                    reduced the immobilization yield on the support. It could be concluded that the</p>

                      <h2 id="section-r4">⁎ The Effect of Crosslinkers Concentration on the Catalytic Activity</h2>  
                      <p>Enzyme immobilization by covalent binding generally includes two steps. First, the
                        support surface is activated using bifunctional agents, and then the enzyme is
                        immobilized on the activated surface covalently. Crosslinkers, often used in covalent
                        binding, behave as a bridge between the support material and enzyme molecules [53].
                        In this part of the study, activation of the supports was carried out with varying
                        quantities of GLA and EPH (150, 200, 250, and 300 mM) for 4 h at 30 °C. Then, the
                        free enzyme was immobilized onto these activated supports as previously mentioned.
                        When GO was activated by glutaraldehyde, with the increasing of glutaraldehyde
                        concentration the activity of immobilized enzyme increased, after 250 mM (2.36%,
                        v/v) of glutaraldehyde concentration the activity decreased. When Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was activated
                        with glutaraldehyde, the highest immobilized enzyme activity was obtained when
                        300 mM (2.83%, v/v) of glutaraldehyde was used. For GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> support material,
                        200 mM (1.90%, v/v) of glutaraldehyde represented the highest enzyme activity, after
                        200 mM (1.90%, v/v) of glutaraldehyde the activity decreased. The three immobilized
                        lipases gain different conformations from each other after the immobilization protocol;
                        therefore, their highest activities are detected at different glutaraldehyde concentrations. However, for each sample, with the increasing GLA concentration, the enzyme
                        activity increased because of the increased concentration of aldehyde groups on the
                        support surfaces. On the other hand, after a certain GLA concentration, the activities
                        of the immobilized preparations were decreased, at a high GLA concentration, the
                        multiple chemical bonds might be generated between the support material and the
                        enzyme molecules [54]. When the carriers were activated with epichlorohydrin at
                        different concentrations, it was observed that enzyme activities were lower than glutaraldehyde <a href="#table 1" id="figure-link">(Table 1)</a>. The results prove glutaraldehyde is more effective than
                        epichlorohydrin on the enzymatic activity.</p>

                        <p>The existence of surfactants during immobilization increases the thermal and chemical stability

                            100 and Tween 80 were analyzed in this study, and the results were presented in <a href="#table 2" id="figure-link">Table 2</a>. In
                            the same conditions, without the use of surfactants, the activity of enzyme immobilized on GO,
                            Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> were 15.33, 14.26, and 13.47 U/mg, respectively <a href="#table 1" id="figure-link">(Table 1)</a>. When 30 mM (3.7% v/v) and 40 mM (4.9%, v/v) of Tween 80 were used, the highest immobilized
                            enzyme activities were 15.03, 14.72, and 13.56 U/mg for GO-GLA-CalB, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GLA-CalB,
                            and GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-GLA-CalB, respectively. The higher concentration of the surfactants caused
                            the decrease in the activity of all three immobilized enzymes. The similar behavior was also
                            observed when Triton X-100 was used as the surfactant. However, the increase in concentration for both surfactants did not have a significant effect on immobilized enzyme activities.
                            There are two possible considerations to explain why there is no significant change in enzyme
                            activity: (i) The interaction time (45 min) between the surfactants, and the support materials is
                            insufficient. (ii) The use of surfactants during the activation process of the support material
                            rather than the enzyme immobilization process.</p>

                                                    are another important parameters. To determine the reuse of immobilized enzymes subsequent
                                                    cycles for three immobilized enzymes were carried out separately. Each of them was used for

After the first and further reaction cycles of the kinetic resolution of 1- phenylethanol, the immobilized lipases were regained from the reaction medium with the use of a magnet or via filtration and washed 3 times with hexane. Then, they were dried to remove the organic solvent, and they were used in the new reaction system. The experiment
                                                    was repeated up to five reaction cycles with the same immobilized lipases.
