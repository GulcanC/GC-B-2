        <h2 id="section-1">⁎ Materials</h2>
        <p>All chemicals were used without further purification. Lipase from C. antarctica B was
            provided by Novozymes. Graphite oxide was supplied by Graphene Company (Turkey). Ferrous chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl<sub>2</sub>. 4H<sub>2</sub>O, 99%), ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl<sub>3</sub>. 6H<sub>2</sub>O, 97%), glutaraldehyde (GA, %50 wt. in H<sub>2</sub>O), epichlorohydrin (EPH),
            and Triton X-100 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>),
            sodium hydroxide (NaOH), toluene, hexane, 1-phenyl ethanol, 2-propanol, vinyl
            acetate, hydrochloric acid (HCl), tween 80, disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate
            (Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O), and monopotassium phosphate (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) were purchased from
            Merck.</p>


    
        
        <h2 id="section-2">⁎ Synthesis of Nanostructures</h2>
        <h3 id="section-3">⭒ Synthesis of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> Nanoparticles</h3>
        <p>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles were prepared by coprecipitation method in alkaline medium reported
            method in the literature [39]. The iron salts were dissolved in aqueous HCl (0.16 M) where the
            mole fraction of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup> was adjusted to 0.5. This solution was dropped into 1 M aqueous
            NaOH solution (50 ml) at 80 °C under the inert atmosphere. After 30-min strong mechanical
            stirring, the magnetic particles were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The
            particles were washed three times with deionized water and dried at 50 °C under vacuum for
            24 h.</p>
            
          

        <h3 id="section-4">⭒ Preparation of GO Nanosheets</h3>
        <p>Preparation of GO was accomplished by ultrasonication of graphite oxide powder. Graphite
            oxide solution was subjected to ultrasonication at room temperature for 1 h. The brown
            dispersion was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min to remove any unexfoliated graphite
            oxide [40].</p>
        <h3 id="section-5">⭒ Preparation of GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>  Nanocomposite</h3>
        <p>The GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanocomposite was synthesized by an ultrasonic-assisted reverse
            coprecipitation method, according to literature [41 ], with some modifications. The
            above-obtained GO (0.2 g) was added to distilled water (25 ml), and the mixture was
            subjected to ultrasonication at room temperature for 30 min. The iron salts, FeSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O
            (0.48 g) and FeCl<sub>3</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O (0.47 g) were dissolved in 25 mL of distilled water, followed
            by the addition of NaOH (1 M) to the iron salts suspension to adjust pH 4. Then, GO
            aqueous dispersion was added into the above suspension. Again, NaOH (1 M) was added
            dropwise to adjust pH from 4 to 10 in order to obtain black precipitates. After that, the
            resulted suspension sonicated at 60 °C for 45 min. Finally, the obtained black GO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
            nanoparticles were collected by magnetic separation, washed with water, and then dried
            under vacuum at 50 °C.</p>
        <h3 id="section-6">⭒ Activation of the Supports</h3>
        <p>In this procedure, 20 mg support material was dissolved in 5 ml of phosphate buffer (PBS)
            (50 mM, pH 7.0), including Triton X-100 or Tween 80 surfactants at five different concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 mM). The mixture was sonicated at room temperature for 45 min
            then the aggregates were separated and washed with deionized water three times. The solution
            of ethylenediamine (2 ml) in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.0) was added, and the suspension
            was stirred at room temperature for 2 h [42]. The precipitates were separated and washed with
            deionized water three times. Next, 250 mM of GLA or EPH (150, 200, 250, and 300 mM) as
            cross-linker was added to the mixture and shaken (150 rpm, 30 °C, 4 h). Finally, the activated
            support materials were recovered from the suspension, washed three times with deionized
            water and dried at room temperature for 24 h.</p>

        <h3 id="section-7">⭒ Lipase Immobilization onto Activated Nanoparticles</h3>
        <p>Activated nanoparticles soaked into phosphate buffer (5 ml, 50 mM) at different pH medium
            (pH 5, pH 6, pH 7, pH 8) including Cal-B (1 ml). The immobilization process was carried out
            in a thermal shaker (150 rpm), with different contact times (8, 12, 16, 20, 24 h) and
            immobilization temperatures (20, 30, 40, 50, 60 °C). Finally, the supports were washed three
            times with phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7) and dried at room temperature for 24 h.</p>

                  <h2 id="section-8">⁎ Enzyme Activity Measurement</h2>  
                  <p>In order to investigate the enzyme activity, low acidity high refined olive oil was chosen as a
                    substrate. In a conical flax, olive oil (2 ml), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (0.1 M, 0.5 ml), phosphate buffer (0.07 M,
                    pH 7, 3 ml), and deionized water (5 ml) were mixed and incubated in a thermal shaker (37 °C,
                    10 min, 150 rpm). After the incubation, native or immobilized lipase was added to the
                    emulsion followed by reaction in a thermal shaker (37 °C, 20 min, 150 rpm). The acetoneethyl alcohol mixture (1:1 v/v) was added to the reaction medium to terminate the reaction.
                    Titration method with NaOH (0.02 M) was chosen to measure the amount of released free fatty
                    acid. A unit (U) lipase activity is known as the amount of a standard lipase preparation that
                    releases 1 mol of fatty acid equivalent per minute from the substrate emulsion under certain
                    assay conditions. To calculate the specific activity of both native and immobilized lipases, Eq.
                    1 was used [43].</p>
